	abstract = {Muscle protein wasting in cancer cachexia is a critical problem. The underlying mechanisms are still unclear, although the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been involved in the degradation of bulk myofibrillar proteins. The present work has been aimed to investigate whether autophagic degradation also plays a role in the onset of muscle depletion in cancer-bearing animals and in glucocorticoid-induced atrophy and sarcopenia of aging. The results show that autophagy is induced in muscle in three different models of cancer cachexia and in glucocorticoid-treated mice. In contrast, autophagic degradation in the muscle of sarcopenic animals is impaired but can be reactivated by calorie restriction. These results further demonstrate that different mechanisms are involved in pathologic muscle wasting and that autophagy, either excessive or defective, contributes to the complicated network that leads to muscle atrophy. In this regard, particularly intriguing is the observation that in cancer hosts and tumor necrosis factor α-treated C2C12 myotubes, insulin can only partially blunt autophagy induction. This finding suggests that autophagy is triggered through mechanisms that cannot be circumvented by using classic upstream modulators, prompting us to identify more effective approaches to target this proteolytic system.

	abstract = {Background Cancer patients undergoing procedures are at increased risk of sepsis. We sought to evaluate the incidence of postoperative sepsis following major cancer surgeries (MCS), and to describe patient and/or hospital characteristics associated with heightened risk.
Methods Patients undergoing 1 of 8 MCS (colectomy, cystectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, hysterectomy, lung resection, pancreatectomy, and prostatectomy) within the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1999-2009 were identified (N = 2,502,710). Logistic regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations were used to estimate primary predictors (procedure, age, gender, race, insurance, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hospital volume, and hospital bed size) effect on sepsis and sepsis-associated mortality. Trends were evaluated with linear regression.
Results The incidence of MCS-related sepsis increased 2.0\% per year (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas mortality remained stable. Odds of sepsis were highest among esophagectomy patients (odds ratio [OR]: 3.13, 2.76-3.55) and those with non-private insurance (OR: 1.33, 1.19-1.48 to OR: 1.89, 1.71-2.09). Odds of sepsis-related mortality were highest among lung resection patients (OR: 2.30, 2.00-2.64) and those experiencing perioperative liver failure (OR: 5.68, 4.30-7.52). Increasing hospital volume was associated with lower odds of sepsis and sepsis-related mortality (OR: 0.89, 0.84-0.95 to OR: 0.58, 0.53-0.62 and OR: 0.88, 0.77-0.99 to OR: 0.78, 0.67-0.93).
Conclusions Between 1999 and 2009, the incidence of MCS-related sepsis increased; however, sepsis-related mortality remained stable. Significant disparities exist in patient and hospital characteristics associated with MCS-related sepsis. Hospital volume is an important modifiable risk factor associated with improved sepsis-related outcomes following MCS.},

	abstract = {Muscle wasting negatively affects morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. This progressive wasting is accompanied by, in general, a normal muscle PS (protein synthesis) rate. In the present study, we investigated whether muscle protein degradation is increased in critically ill patients with sepsis and which proteolytic enzyme systems are involved in this degradation. Eight patients and seven healthy volunteers were studied. In vivo muscle protein kinetics was measured using arteriovenous balance techniques with stable isotope tracers. The activities of the major proteolytic enzyme systems were analysed in combination with mRNA expression of genes related to these proteolytic systems. Results show that critically ill patients with sepsis have a variable but normal muscle PS rate, whereas protein degradation rates are dramatically increased (up to 160\%). Of the major proteolytic enzyme systems both the proteasome and the lysosomal systems had higher activities in the patients, whereas calpain and caspase activities were not changed. Gene expression of several genes related to the proteasome system was increased in the patients. mRNA levels of the two main lysosomal enzymes (cathepsin B and L) were not changed but, conversely, genes related to calpain and caspase had a higher expression in the muscles of the patients. In conclusion, the dramatic muscle wasting seen in critically ill patients with sepsis is due to increased protein degradation. This is facilitated by increased activities of both the proteasome and lysosomal proteolytic systems.},

A better understanding of the blood systems response to sepsis should expedite the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. Methods .

We identified 6 cohorts consisting of 450 individuals (sepsis = 323, control = 127) providing genome-wide messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data. Through meta-analysis we found the “Lysosome” and “Cytoskeleton” pathways were upregulated in human sepsis patients relative to controls, in addition to previously known signaling pathways (including MAPK, TLR). The key regulatory genes in the “Lysosome” pathway include lysosomal acid hydrolases (e.g., protease cathepsin A, D) as well as the major (LAMP1, 2) and minor (SORT1, LAPTM4B) membrane proteins. In contrast, pathways related to “Ribosome”, “Spliceosome” and “Cell adhesion molecules” were found to be downregulated, along with known pathways for immune dysfunction. Overall, our study revealed distinct mRNA activation profiles and protein-protein interaction networks in blood of human sepsis. Conclusions . Our findings suggest that aberrant mRNA expression in the lysosome and cytoskeleton pathways may play a pivotal role in the molecular pathobiology of human sepsis.},

When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents.

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal types of cancer worldwide, with poor prognosis and limited treatments. In order to identify novel therapeutic targets that will lead to development of effective therapies with manageable side effects, we tested the hypothesis that knocking-down galactokinase (GALK1) or galactose-1 phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) gene expression would control the growth of cultured hepatoma cells. Our results showed small interfering RNA (siRNA) against GALK1 or GALT inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in culture. Western blot analysis revealed simultaneous down-regulation of multiple players of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) growth signaling pathway, as well as heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) data, however, showed no significant mRNA reduction of the encoded genes. Our study thus not only supports GALK1 and GALT as being possible novel targets for treating HCC, but also uncovers new post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that link the galactose metabolic pathway to protein expression of the PI3K/AKT pathway in hepatoma.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review—Sepsis, defined by the presence of infection and host inflammation, is a lethal clinical syndrome with an increasing mortality rate worldwide. In severe disease, the coagulation system becomes diffusely activated, with consumption of multiple clotting factors resulting in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). When present, DIC portends a higher mortality rate. Understanding the mechanisms that tie inflammation and diffuse thrombosis will allow therapeutic interventions to be developed. The Coagulopathy of Acute Sepsis is a dynamic process that is time and disease burden specific. Whole blood testing of coagulation may provide more clinically useful information than classical tests. Natural anticoagulants that regulate thrombosis are down regulated in sepsis. Patients may benefit from modulation of the coagulation system when systemic inflammation and hypercoagulopathy exist. Proper timing of anticoagulant therapy may ultimately lead to decreased incidence of multisystem organ dysfunction (MODS). Recent Findings—The pathogenesis of coagulopathy in sepsis is driven by an up-regulation of procoagulant mechanisms and simultaneous down-regulation of natural anticoagulants. Inflammation caused by the invading organism is a natural host defense than cannot be eliminated during treatment. Successful strategies to prevent MODS center on stratifying patients at high risk for DIC and restoring the balance of inflammation and coagulation. Summary—The prevention of DIC in septic patients is a key therapeutic target in preventing death from multisystem organ failure. Stratifying patients for therapy using thromboelastometry, specific markers for DIC, and composite scoring systems is an area of growing research.},

The extracellular matrix directs repair by regulating the behavior of the wide variety of cell types that are mobilized to the damaged area in order to rebuild the tissue. Acute inflammation, re-epithelialization, and contraction all depend on cell-extracellular matrix interactions and contribute to minimize infection and promote rapid wound closure. Matricellular proteins are up-regulated during wound healing where they modulate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix to exert control over events that are essential for efficient tissue repair. Here, we discuss how the extracellular matrix changes during the stages of tissue repair, how matricellular proteins affect cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and how these proteins might be exploited for use therapeutically. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Multiple lung pathogens such as chemical agents, H5N1 avian flu, or SARS cause high lethality due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Here we report that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mutant mice display natural resistance to acid-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We show that TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling is a key disease pathway that controls the severity of ALI. The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI. Our data identify oxidative stress and innate immunity as key lung injury pathways that control the severity of ALI. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2016.2691},
	abstract = {Importance: Sepsis is considered to induce immune suppression, leading to increased susceptibility to secondary infections with associated late mortality. Objective: To determine the clinical and host genomic characteristics, incidence, and attributable mortality of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections in patients admitted to the ICU with or without sepsis. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective observational study comprising consecutive admissions of more than 48 hours in 2 ICUs in the Netherlands from January 2011 to July 2013 stratified according to admission diagnosis (sepsis or noninfectious). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was ICU-acquired infection (onset {\textgreater}48 hours). Attributable mortality risk (fraction of mortality that can be prevented by elimination of the risk factor, acquired infection) was determined using time-to-event models accounting for competing risk. In a subset of sepsis admissions (n = 461), blood gene expression (whole-genome transcriptome in leukocytes) was analyzed at baseline and at onset of ICU-acquired infectious (n = 19) and noninfectious (n = 9) events. Results: The primary cohort included 1719 sepsis admissions (1504 patients; median age, 62 years; interquartile range [IQR], 51-71 years]; 924 men [61.4\%]). A comparative cohort included 1921 admissions (1825 patients, median age, 62 years; IQR, 49-71 years; 1128 men [61.8\%] in whom infection was not present in the first 48 hours. Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred in 13.5\% of sepsis ICU admissions (n = 232) and 15.1\% of nonsepsis ICU admissions (n = 291). Patients with sepsis who developed an ICU-acquired infection had higher disease severity scores on admission than patients with sepsis who did not develop an ICU-acquired infection (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV [APACHE IV] median score, 90 [IQR, 72-107] vs 79 [IQR, 62-98]; P {\textless} .001) and throughout their ICU stay but did not have differences in baseline gene expression. The population attributable mortality fraction of ICU-acquired infections in patients with sepsis was 10.9\% (95\% CI, 0.9\%-20.6\%) by day 60; the estimated difference between mortality in all patients with a sepsis admission diagnosis and mortality in those without ICU-acquired infection was 2.0\% (95\% CI, 0.2\%-3.8\%; P = .03) by day 60. Among nonsepsis ICU admissions, ICU-acquired infections had a population attributable mortality fraction of 21.1\% (95\% CI, 0.6\%-41.7\%) by day 60. Compared with baseline, blood gene expression at the onset of ICU-acquired infections showed reduced expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis. Conclusions and Relevance: Intensive care unit-acquired infections occurred more commonly in patients with sepsis with higher disease severity, but such infections contributed only modestly to overall mortality. The genomic response of patients with sepsis was consistent with immune suppression at the onset of secondary infection.},

	abstract = {Background Host responses during sepsis are highly heterogeneous, which hampers the identification of patients at high risk of mortality and their selection for targeted therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify biologically relevant molecular endotypes in patients with sepsis. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study that included consecutive patients admitted for sepsis to two intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and July 20, 2012 (discovery and first validation cohorts) and patients admitted with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia to 29 ICUs in the UK (second validation cohort). We generated genome-wide blood gene expression profiles from admission samples and analysed them by unsupervised consensus clustering and machine learning. The primary objective of this study was to establish endotypes for patients with sepsis, and assess the association of these endotypes with clinical traits and survival outcomes. We also established candidate biomarkers for the endotypes to allow identification of patient endotypes in clinical practice. Findings The discovery cohort had 306 patients, the first validation cohort had 216, and the second validation cohort had 265 patients. Four molecular endotypes for sepsis, designated Mars1–4, were identified in the discovery cohort, and were associated with 28-day mortality (log-rank p=0·022). In the discovery cohort, the worst outcome was found for patients classified as having a Mars1 endotype, and at 28 days, 35 (39\%) of 90 people with a Mars1 endotype had died (hazard ratio [HR] vs all other endotypes 1·86 [95\% CI 1·21–2·86]; p=0·0045), compared with 23 (22\%) of 105 people with a Mars2 endotype (HR 0·64 [0·40–1·04]; p=0·061), 16 (23\%) of 71 people with a Mars3 endotype (HR 0·71 [0·41–1·22]; p=0·19), and 13 (33\%) of 40 patients with a Mars4 endotype (HR 1·13 [0·63–2·04]; p=0·69). Analysis of the net reclassification improvement using a combined clinical and endotype model significantly improved risk prediction to 0·33 (0·09–0·58; p=0·008). A 140-gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with sepsis to the four endotypes in both the first and second validation cohorts. Only Mars1 was consistently significantly associated with 28-day mortality across the cohorts. To facilitate possible clinical use, a biomarker was derived for each endotype; BPGM and TAP2 reliably identified patients with a Mars1 endotype. Interpretation This study provides a method for the molecular classification of patients with sepsis to four different endotypes upon ICU admission. Detection of sepsis endotypes might assist in providing personalised patient management and in selection for trials. Funding Center for Translational Molecular Medicine, Netherlands.},

Measurements and Main Results: A unified clustering analysis across 14 discovery datasets revealed three subtypes, which, based on functional analysis, we termed "Inflammopathic, Adaptive, and Coagulopathic." We then validated these subtypes in nine independent datasets from five different countries (n = 600). In both discovery and validation data, the Adaptive subtype is associated with a lower clinical severity and lower mortality rate, and the Coagulopathic subtype is associated with higher mortality and clinical coagulopathy. Further, these clusters are statistically associated with clusters derived by others in independent single sepsis cohorts. Conclusions: The three sepsis subtypes may represent a unifying framework for understanding the molecular heterogeneity of the sepsis syndrome.

	abstract = {Background: Effective targeted therapy for sepsis requires an understanding of the heterogeneity in the individual host response to infection. We investigated this heterogeneity by defining interindividual variation in the transcriptome of patients with sepsis and related this to outcome and genetic diversity. Methods: We assayed peripheral blood leucocyte global gene expression for a prospective discovery cohort of 265 adult patients admitted to UK intensive care units with sepsis due to community-acquired pneumonia and evidence of organ dysfunction. We then validated our findings in a replication cohort consisting of a further 106 patients. We mapped genomic determinants of variation in gene transcription between patients as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Findings: We discovered that following admission to intensive care, transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood leucocytes defines two distinct sepsis response signatures (SRS1 and SRS2). The presence of SRS1 (detected in 108 [41\%] patients in discovery cohort) identifies individuals with an immunosuppressed phenotype that included features of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell exhaustion, and downregulation of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II. SRS1 was associated with higher 14 day mortality than was SRS2 (discovery cohort hazard ratio (HR) 2.4, 95\% CI 1.3-4.5, p=0.005; validation cohort HR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.5-5.1, p=0.0007). We found that a predictive set of seven genes enabled the classification of patients as SRS1 or SRS2. We identified cis-acting and trans-acting eQTL for key immune and metabolic response genes and sepsis response networks. Sepsis eQTL were enriched in endotoxin-induced epigenetic marks and modulated the individual host response to sepsis, including effects specific to SRS group. We identified regulatory genetic variants involving key mediators of gene networks implicated in the hypoxic response and the switch to glycolysis that occurs in sepsis, including HIF1alpha and mTOR, and mediators of endotoxin tolerance, T-cell activation, and viral defence. Interpretation: Our integrated genomics approach advances understanding of heterogeneity in sepsis by defining subgroups of patients with different immune response states and prognoses, as well as revealing the role of underlying genetic variation. Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis and create opportunities for a precision medicine approach to enable targeted therapeutic intervention to improve sepsis outcomes.

	abstract = {Septic syndrome is the leading cause of mortality for critically ill patients worldwide. Patients develop lymphocyte dysfunctions associated with increased risk of death and nosocomial infections. In this study, we performed preclinical experiments testing the potential of recombinant human IL-7 (rhIL-7) as a lymphostimulating therapy in sepsis. Circulating IL-7 and soluble IL-7 receptor a-chain (soluble CD127) concentrations were measured in plasma, whereas cellular CD127 expression was evaluated on circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes from septic shock patients and healthy volunteers. Lymphocyte proliferation, IFN-g production, STAT5 phosphorylation, and B cell lymphoma 2 induction were measured ex vivo in response to T cell stimulation in the presence or not of rhIL-7. We show that IL-7 pathway (plasmatic IL-7 concentration and cellular and soluble CD127 expressions) is not overtly altered and remains activable in septic patients. Most importantly ex vivo treatment of patients' cells with rhIL-7 significantly improves lymphocyte functionality (CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte proliferations, IFN-g production, STAT5 phosphorylation, and B cell lymphoma 2 induction after stimulation). To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of rhIL-7 ability to restore normal lymphocyte functions in septic patients. These results support the rational for initiating a clinical trial testing rhIL-7 in septic shock. Copyright © 2012 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {IL-15 is a pluripotent antiapoptotic cytokine that signals to cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and is regarded as a highly promising immunomodulatory agent in cancer therapy. Sepsis is a lethal condition in which apoptosis-induced depletion of immune cells and subsequent immunosuppression are thought to contribute to morbidity and mortality. This study tested the ability of IL-15 to block apoptosis, prevent immunosuppression, and improve survival in sepsis. Mice were made septic using cecal ligation and puncture or Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. The experiments comprised a 2 x 2 full factorial design with surgical sepsis versus sham and IL-15 versus vehicle. In addition to survival studies, splenic cellularity, canonical markers of activation and proliferation, intracellular pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression, and markers of immune cell apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cytokine production was examined both in plasma of treated mice and splenocytes that were stimulated ex vivo. IL-15 blocked sepsis-induced apoptosis of NK cells, dendritic cells, and CD8 T cells. IL-15 also decreased sepsis-induced gut epithelial apoptosis. IL-15 therapy increased the abundance of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 while decreasing proapoptotic Bim and PUMA. IL-15 increased both circulating IFN-gamma, as well as the percentage of NK cells that produced IFN-gamma. Finally, IL-15 increased survival in both cecal ligation and puncture and P. aeruginosa pneumonia. In conclusion, IL-15 prevents two immunopathologic hallmarks of sepsis, namely, apoptosis and immunosuppression, and improves survival in two different models of sepsis. IL-15 represents a potentially novel therapy of this highly lethal disorder.},

Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in most intensive care units. Unfavorable outcomes of several high-profile trials in the treatment of sepsis have led researchers to state that sepsis studies need a new direction. The immune response that occurs during sepsis is characterized by a cytokine-mediated hyper-inflammatory phase, which most patients survive, and a subsequent immunosuppressive phase. Therefore, therapies that improve host immunity might increase the survival of patients with sepsis. Many mechanisms are responsible for sepsis-induced immunosuppression, including apoptosis of immune cells, increased regulatory T cells and expression of programmed cell death 1 on CD4+ T cells, and cellular exhaustion. Immunomodulatory molecules that were recently identified include interleukin-7, interleukin-15, and anti-programmed cell death 1.

A manual review of references was also performed. Eligible studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) that compared granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) therapy with placebo for the treatment of sepsis in adults. Main outcome measures were all-cause mortality at 14 days and 28 days after initiation of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy, in-hospital mortality, reversal rate from infection, and adverse events.Results: Twelve RCTs with 2,380 patients were identified. In regard to 14-day mortality, a total of 9 death events occurred among 71 patients (12.7\%) in the treatment group compared with 13 events among 67 patients (19.4\%) in the placebo groups. Meta-analysis showed there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality when G-CSF or GM-CSF were compared with placebo (relative risks (RR) = 0.93, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 to 1.11, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.31, I2 = 15\%). Compared with placebo, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy did not significantly reduce in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.97, 95\% CI: 0.69 to 1.36, P = 0.86; P for heterogeneity = 0.80, I2 = 0\%). However, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy significantly increased the reversal rate from infection (RR = 1.34, 95\% CI: 1.11 to 1.62, P = 0.002; P for heterogeneity = 0.47, I2 = 0\%). No significant difference was observed in adverse events between groups (RR = 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.70 to 1.23, P = 0.62; P for heterogeneity = 0.03, I2 = 58\%).

	abstract = {Introduction: Lymphocyte apoptosis and monocyte dysfunction play a pivotal role in sepsis-induced immunosuppression. Programmed death-1 (PD1) and its ligand programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) exert inhibitory function by regulating the balance among T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. PD-1 deficiency or blockade has been shown to improve survival in murine sepsis. However, PD-L1 and PD-1 differ in their expression patterns and the role of PD-L1 in sepsis-induced immunosuppression is still unknown.Methods: Sepsis was induced in adult C57BL/6 male mice via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells, B cells and monocytes were measured 24 hours after CLP or sham surgery. Additionally, the effects of anti-PD-L1 antibody on lymphocyte number, apoptosis of spleen and thymus, activities of caspase-8 and caspase-9, cytokine p roduction, bacterial clearance, and survival were determined.Results: Expression of PD-1 on T cells, B cells and monocytes and PD-L1 on B cells and monocytes were up-regulated in septic animals compared to sham-operated controls. PD-L1 blockade significantly improved survival of CLP mice. Anti-PD-L1 antibody administration prevented sepsis-induced depletion of lymphocytes, increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 production, decreased IL-10 production, and enhanced bacterial clearance.Conclusions: PD-L1 blockade exerts a protective effect on sepsis at least partly by inhibiting lymphocyte apoptosis and reversing monocyte dysfunction.

	doi = {10.1189/jlb.0110037},
	abstract = {There is increasing recognition that a major pathophysiologic event in sepsis is the progression to an immunosuppressive state in which the host is unable to eradicate invading pathogens. Although there are likely numerous causes for the immunosuppression, expression of negative costimulatory molecules on immune effector cells is a likely contributing factor. PD-1 is a recently described, negative costimulatory molecule that has potent effects to inhibit T cell activation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic functions. PD-1 plays a critical role in the host response to specific pathogens, but relatively little work has been done on the possible effects of PD-1 in sepsis. We hypothesized that the anti-PD-1 antibody would improve survival in sepsis. Mice underwent CLP, and PD-1 expression was quantitated. Additionally, the effects of anti-PD-1 antibody on lymphocyte apoptosis, cytokine production, host immunity, and survival were determined. PD-1 expression increased beginning 48 h after sepsis, and {\textgreater}20\% of CD4 and CD8 T cells were positive by 7 days. Anti-PD-1 antibody administered 24 h after sepsis prevented sepsis-induced depletion of lymphocytes and DCs, increased Bcl-xL, blocked apoptosis, and improved survival. Anti-PD-1 also prevented the loss in DTH, a key indicator of immunocompetence in sepsis. Thus, delayed administration of anti-PD-1 antibody, an important therapeutic advantage, was effective in sepsis. Furthermore, these results add to the growing body of evidence that modulation of the positive and negative costimulatory pathways on immune cells represents a viable therapeutic approach in reversing immunosuppression and improving sepsis survival.},

The aim of the study was to test potential immunomodulatory approaches to restore the capacity of splenic DC to secrete interleukin (IL) 12 that represents the key cytokine in Th1 cell polarization. Murine polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Splenic DC were isolated at different time points after CLP or sham operation, and stimulated with bacterial components in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies, murine interferon (IFN) γ, and/or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). DC from septic mice showed an impaired capacity to release the pro-inflammatory and Th1-promoting cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 in response to bacterial stimuli, but secreted IL-10. Endogenous IL-10 was not responsible for the impaired IL-12 secretion. Up to 6 h after CLP, the combined treatment of DC from septic mice with IFN-γ and GM-CSF increased the secretion of IL-12. Later, DC from septic mice responded to IFN-γ and GM-CSF with increased expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, while IL-12 secretion was no more enhanced. In contrast, splenic macrophages from septic mice during late sepsis responded to GM-CSF with increased cytokine release. Thus, therapy of sepsis with IFN-γ/GM-CSF might be sufficient to restore the activity of macrophages, but fails to restore DC function adequate for the development of a protective Th1-like immune response.},

	abstract = {Context: Severe sepsis is typically characterized by initial cytokine-mediated hyper-inflammation. Whether this hyperinflammatory phase is followed by immunosuppression is controversial. Animal studies suggest that multiple immune defects occur in sepsis, but data from humans remain conflicting. Objectives: To determine the association of sepsis with changes in host innate and adaptive immunity and to examine potential mechanisms for putative immunosuppression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Rapid postmortem spleen and lung tissue harvest was performed at the bedsides of 40 patients who died in intensive care units (ICUs) of academic medical centers with active severe sepsis to characterize their immune status at the time of death (2009-2011). Control spleens (n=29) were obtained from patients who were declared brain-dead or had emergent splenectomy due to trauma; control lungs (n=20) were obtained from transplant donors or from lung cancer resections. Main Outcome Measures: Cytokine secretion assays and immunophenotyping of cell surface receptor-ligand expression profiles were performed to identify potential mechanisms of immune dysfunction. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the loss of immune effector cells. Results: The mean ages of patients with sepsis and controls were 71.7 (SD, 15.9) and 52.7 (SD, 15.0) years, respectively. The median number of ICU days for patients with sepsis was 8 (range, 1-195 days), while control patients were in ICUs for 4 or fewer days. The median duration of sepsis was 4 days (range, 1-40 days). Compared with controls, anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes from sepsis patients had significant reductions in cytokine secretion at 5 hours: tumor necrosis factor, 5361 (95\% CI, 3327-7485) pg/mL vs 418 (95\% CI, 98-738) pg/mL; interferon γ, 1374 (95\% CI, 550-2197) pg/mL vs 37.5 (95\% CI, -5 to 80) pg/mL; interleukin 6, 3691 (95\% CI, 2313-5070) vs 365 (95\% CI, 87-642) pg/mL; and interleukin 10, 633 (95\% CI, -269 to 1534) vs 58 (95\% CI, -39 to 156) pg/mL; (P{\textless}.001 for all). There were similar reductions in 5-hour lipopolysaccharide- stimulated cytokine secretion. Cytokine secretion in sepsis patients was generally less than 10\% that in controls, independent of age, duration of sepsis, corticosteroid use, and nutritional status. Although differences existed between spleen and lung, flow cytometric analysis showed increased expression of selected inhibitory receptors and ligands and expansion of suppressor cell populations in both organs. Unique differences in cellular inhibitory molecule expression existed in immune cells isolated from lungs of sepsis patients vs cancer patients and vs transplant donors. Immunohistochemical staining showed extensive depletion of splenic CD4, CD8, and HLA-DR cells and expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on lung epithelial cells. Conclusions: Patients who die in the ICU following sepsis compared with patients who die of nonsepsis etiologies have biochemical, flow cytometric, and immunohistochemical findings consistent with immunosuppression. Targeted immune-enhancing therapy may be a valid approach in selected patients with sepsis. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

Most of them are clearly transforming as they promote invasive growth, angiogenesis and drug resistance. The same changes can, however, strongly sensitize cells to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and thereby to lysosome-targeting anti-cancer drugs.

	doi = {10.1186/1479-7364-7-23},
	abstract = {Background: Up to 20\% of cancers worldwide are thought to be associated with microbial pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. The widely used methods of viral infection detection are usually limited to a few a priori suspected viruses in one cancer type. To our knowledge, there have not been many broad screening approaches to address this problem more comprehensively. Methods: In this study, we performed a comprehensive screening for viruses in nine common cancers using a multistep computational approach. Tumor transcriptome and genome sequencing data were available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Nine hundred fifty eight primary tumors in nine common cancers with poor prognosis were screened against a non-redundant database of virus sequences. DNA sequences from normal matched tissue specimens were used as controls to test whether each virus is associated with tumors. Results: We identified human papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) and four human herpes viruses (HHV) types 4, 5, 6B, and 8, also known as EBV, CMV, roseola virus, and KSHV, in colon, rectal, and stomach adenocarcinomas. In total, 59\% of screened gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas (GIA) were positive for at least one virus: 26\% for EBV, 21\% for CMV, 7\% for HHV-6B, and 20\% for HPV-18. Over 20\% of tumors were co-infected with multiple viruses. Two viruses (EBV and CMV) were statistically significantly associated with colorectal cancers when compared to the matched healthy tissues from the same individuals (p = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). HPV-18 was not detected in DNA, and thus, no association testing was possible. Nevertheless, HPV-18 expression patterns suggest viral integration in the host genome, consistent with the potentially oncogenic nature of HPV-18 in colorectal adenocarcinomas. The estimated counts of viral copies were below one per cell for all identified viruses and approached the detection limit. Conclusions: Our comprehensive screening for viruses in multiple cancer types using next-generation sequencing data clearly demonstrates the presence of viral sequences in GIA. EBV, CMV, and HPV-18 are potentially causal for GIA, although their oncogenic role is yet to be established. © 2013 Salyakina and Tsinoremas.},

This notion has undergone a radical shift in the last 10 years, with new research revealing that this organelle serves as a major hub for metabolic signaling pathways. The discovery that master growth regulators, including the protein kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), make their home at the lysosomal surface has generated intense interest in the lysosome's key role in nutrient sensing and cellular homeostasis. The transcriptional networks required for lysosomal maintenance and function are just being unraveled and their connection to lysosome-based signaling pathways revealed. The catabolic and anabolic pathways that converge on the lysosome connect this organelle with multiple facets of cellular function; when these pathways are deregulated they underlie multiple human diseases, and promote cellular and organismal aging. Thus, understanding how lysosome-based signaling pathways function will not only illuminate the fascinating biology of this organelle but will also be critical in unlocking its therapeutic potentials.},

The resulting map confirms and extends current knowledge. We observe recurrent fusion events, including human papillomavirus insertions in RAD51B and ERBB2. Patterns of coadaptation between host and viral gene expression give clues to papillomavirus oncogene function. Importantly, our analysis argues strongly against viral aetiology in several cancers where this has frequently been proposed.

We also found three HPV16-positive samples in brain lower grade glioma (LGG). Further, recurrent HBV integration at the KMT2B locus is present in three liver tumors, but absent in their matched adjacent normal samples, indicating that viral integration induced host driver genetic alterations are required on top of viral oncogene expression for initiation and progression of liver hepatocellular carcinoma. Notably, viral integrations were found in many genes, including novel recurrent HPV integrations at PTPN13 in cervical cancer. Finally, we observed a set of HHV4 and HBV variants strongly associated with ethnic groups, likely due to viral sequence evolution under environmental influences.

In this study, we sought to identify new virus-cancer associations by searching RNA sequencing data sets from {\textgreater}2,000 patients, encompassing 21 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), for the presence of viral sequences. In agreement with previous studies, we found human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) and HPV18 in oropharyngeal cancer and hepatitis B and C viruses in liver cancer. Unexpectedly, however, we found HPV38, a cutaneous form of HPV associated with skin cancer, in 32 of 168 samples from endometrial cancer. In 12 of the HPV38-positive (HPV38 + ) samples, we observed at least one paired read that mapped to both human and HPV38 genomes, indicative of viral integration into the host DNA, something not previously demonstrated for HPV38. The expression levels of HPV38 transcripts were relatively low, and all 32 HPV38 + samples belonged to the same experimental batch of 40 samples, whereas none of the other 128 endometrial carcinoma samples were HPV38 + , raising doubts about the significance of the HPV38 association. Moreover, the HPV38 + samples contained the same 10 novel single nucleotide variations (SNVs), leading us to hypothesize that one patient was infected with this new isolate of HPV38, which was integrated into his/her genome and may have cross-contaminated other TCGA samples within batch 228. Based on our analysis, we propose guidelines to examine the batch effect, virus expression level, and SNVs as part of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis for evaluating the significance of viral/pathogen sequences in clinical samples.  IMPORTANCE High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), followed by computational analysis, has vastly accelerated the identification of viral and other pathogenic sequences in clinical samples, but cross-contamination during the processing of the samples remain a major problem that can lead to erroneous conclusions. We found HPV38 sequences specifically present in RNA-Seq samples from endometrial cancer patients from TCGA, a virus not previously associated with this type of cancer. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest possible cross-contamination in these samples, which were processed together in the same batch. Despite this potential cross-contamination, our data indicate that we have detected a new isolate of HPV38 that appears to be integrated into the human genome. We also provide general guidelines for computational detection and interpretation of pathogen-disease associations.},

In this study we show that under proinflammatory conditions the noncanonical Wnt protein, Wnt5a, induces immunosuppressive macrophages. The suppressive phenotype induced by Wnt5a is associated with induction of IL-10 and inhibition of the classical TLR4-NF-κB signaling. Interestingly, this phenotype closely resembles that observed in reprogrammed monocytes in sepsis patients. The Wnt5a-induced feedback inhibition is active both during in vitro LPS stimulation of macrophages and in patients with sepsis caused by LPS-containing, gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, using breast cancer patient tissue microarrays, we find a strong correlation between the expression of Wnt5a in malignant epithelial cells and the frequency of CD163(+) anti-inflammatory tumor-associated macrophages. In conclusion, our data point out Wnt5a as a potential target for an efficient therapeutic modality in severe human diseases as diverse as sepsis and malignancy.},

	abstract = {Muscle wasting in patients with sepsis, severe injury, and cancer is associated with increased transcription of several genes regulating different proteolytic pathways. The involvement of gene activation in muscle wasting suggests that transcription factors and nuclear cofactors play important roles in the regulation of muscle mass. Among transcription factors, NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and FOXO transcription factors are activated in atrophying muscle and stimulate the transcription of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway, as well as genes regulating authophagy/lysosomal proteolysis. Changes in the expression and activity of several nuclear cofactors, including the histone acetyltransferase p300, histone deacetylases (HDACs), such as HDAC3, HDAC6, and SIRT1, as well as the nuclear cofactors PGC-1α and β, contribute to loss of muscle mass in various catabolic conditions. The activity of transcription factors and nuclear cofactors involved in the regulation of muscle mass is influenced not only by their abundance, but also by posttranslational modifications as well, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation. Transcription factors and nuclear cofactors involved in muscle wasting interact with each other at multiple levels, supporting the concept that the molecular regulation of muscle mass in various catabolic conditions is complex. An increased understanding of molecules that modulate gene transcription in catabolic muscle may make it possible to develop treatments targeting transcription factors and nuclear cofactors in the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

The standard methods of treatment often do not lead to the expected effects. Therefore, it is extremely important to find new, more effective treatments. One of the most promising research directions is immunotherapy, including the use of specific types of microorganisms. This type of treatment is expected to stimulate the immune system for the selective elimination of cancer cells. The research results seem to be promising and show the intensive activation of the immune response as a result of bacterial stimulation. In addition, it is possible to use microorganisms in many different ways, based on their specific properties, that is, toxin production, anaerobic lifestyle, or binding substances that can be delivered to a specific location (vectors). This paper provides an overview of selected microorganisms which are already in use or that are in the experimental phase. Just like any other therapy, the use of microbes for cancer treatment also has some disadvantages. Nevertheless, this kind of treatment can supplement conventional anticancer therapy, giving cancer patients a chance and hope of recovery.},

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are associated with systemic inflammation and acquired immunodeficiency, which promote cardiovascular disease, body wasting, and infections as leading causes of death. This phenomenon persists despite dialysis-related triggers of immune deregulation having been largely eliminated. Here we propose a potential immunoregulatory role of the intestinal microbiota in CKD/ESRD. We discuss how the metabolic alterations of uremia favor pathogen overgrowth (dysbiosis) in the gut and an increased translocation of living bacteria and bacterial components. This process has the potential to activate innate immunity and systemic inflammation. Persistent innate immune activation involves the induction of immunoregulatory mediators that suppress innate and adaptive immunity, similar to the concept of 'endotoxin tolerance' or 'immune paralysis' in advanced sepsis or chronic infections. Renal science has largely neglected the gut as a source of triggers for CKD/ESRD-related immune derangements and complications and lags behind on the evolving microbiota research. Interdisciplinary research activities at all levels are needed to unravel the pathogenic role of the intestinal microbiota in kidney disease and to evaluate if therapeutic interventions that manipulate the microbiota, such as pre-or probiotics, have a therapeutic potential to correct CKD/ESRD-related immune deregulation and to prevent the associated complications. © 2013 International Society of Nephrology.},

Methods: Medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología located in Mexico City from January 2008 to February 2010. There were no interventions. Eighty-two consecutive cancer patients with septic shock aged over 18 years were prospectively included and evaluated. Results: During the study period, 620 critically ill cancer patients were admitted to ICU. Ninety-four patients were evaluated for septic shock at the request of ward onco-hematologists or surgeon oncologist responsible for the patient. After being evaluated by the intensivists, 82 patients were admitted to the ICU. Of the 82 patients, 56 (68.3\%) had solid tumours and 26 (31.7\%) had hematological malignancy. The most frequent sites of infection were: abdominal (57.3\%) and respiratory (35.8\%). Cultures were positive in 41 (50\%) patients. The 63.4\% of the patients had three or more organ dysfunctions on the day of their admission to the ICU. Cox multivariate analysis identified the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [hazard ratio (HR): 1.11; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 1.02-1.19, P = 0.008) and performance status (PS)≥2 (HR: 1.84; 95\% CI: 1.03- 3.29, P = 0.040) as independent predictors of death to 3 months. The ICU mortality rate was 41.5\% (95\% CI: 31-52\%). Conclusion: The variables associated with increased mortality were the degree of organ dysfunction determined by SOFA score at ICU admission and PS≥2. © The Author 2011.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Infection is an important complication in cancer patients, which frequently leads to or prolongs hospitalization, and can also lead to acute organ dysfunction (severe sepsis) and eventually death. While cancer patients are known to be at higher risk for infection and subsequent complications, there is no national estimate of the magnitude of this problem. Our objective was to identify cancer patients with severe sepsis and to project these numbers to national levels. METHODS: Data for all 1999 hospitalizations from six states (Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, and Washington) were merged with US Census data, Centers for Disease Control vital statistics and National Cancer Institute, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results initiative cancer prevalence data. Malignant neoplasms were identified by International Classification of Disease (ninth revision, clinical modification) (ICD-9-CM) codes (140-208), and infection and acute organ failure were identified from ICD-9-CM codes following Angus and colleagues. Cases were identified as a function of age and were projected to national levels. RESULTS: There were 606,176 cancer hospitalizations identified, with severe sepsis present in 29,795 (4.9\%). Projecting national estimates for the US population, cancer patients account for 126,209 severe sepsis cases annually, or 16.4 cases per 1000 people with cancer per year. The inhospital mortality for cancer patients with severe sepsis was 37.8\%. Compared with the overall population, cancer patients are much more likely to be hospitalized (relative risk, 2.77; 95\% confidence interval, 2.77-2.78) and to be hospitalized with severe sepsis (relative risk, 3.96; 95\% confidence interval, 3.94-3.99). Overall, severe sepsis is associated with 8.5\% (46,729) of all cancer deaths at a cost of 3.4 billion dollars per year. CONCLUSION: Severe sepsis is a common, deadly, and costly complication in cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in cancer patients admitted to a medical ICU. Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective study in 162 consecutive cancer patients admitted to the medical ICU of a 1000-bed university hospital between January 2009 and June 2012. Medical history, physical and laboratory findings on admission, and therapeutic interventions during ICU stay were recorded. The study end point was ICU mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for ICU mortality. Results: The study cohort consisted of 104 (64.2\%) patients with solid tumors and 58 patients (35.8\%) with hematological malignancies. The major causes of ICU admission were sepsis/septic shock (66.7\%) and respiratory failure (63.6\%), respectively. Overall ICU mortality rate was 55 \% (n = 89). The ICU mortality rates were similar in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors (57\% vs 53.8\%; P = .744). Four variables were independent predictors for ICU mortality in cancer patients: the remission status of the underlying cancer on ICU admission (odds ratio [OR], 0.113; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.027-0.48; P = .003), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.032-1.215; P = .007), sepsis/septic shock during ICU stay (OR, 8.94; 95\% CI, 2.28-35; P = .002), and vasopressor requirement (OR 16.84; 95\% CI, 3.98-71.24; P = .0001). Although Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (OR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.054-1.61; P = .014), admission through emergency service (OR, 0.005; 95\% CI, 0.00-0.69; P = .035), and vasopressor requirement during ICU stay (OR, 140.64; 95\% CI, 3.59-5505.5; P = .008) were independent predictors for ICU mortality in patients with hematological malignancies, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (OR, 1.83; 95\% CI, 1.29-2.6; P = .001), lactate dehydrogenase level on admission (OR, 1.002; 95\% CI, 1-1.005; P = .028), sepsis/septic shock during ICU stay (OR, 138.4; 95\% CI, 12.54-1528.4; P = .0001), and complete or partial remission of the underlying cancer (OR, 0.026; 95\% CI, 0.002-0.3; P = .004) were the independent risk factors in patients with solid tumors. Conclusion: Intensive care unit mortality rate was 55\% in our cancer patients, which suggests that patients with cancer can benefit from ICU admission. We also found that ICU mortality rates of patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors were similar. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Intestinal disorders often occur in cancer patients, in association with body weight loss, and this alteration is commonly attributed to the chemotherapy. Here, using a mouse model of cancer cachexia induced by ectopic transplantation of C26 cancer cells, we discovered a profound alteration in the gut functions (gut permeability, epithelial turnover, gut immunity, microbial dysbiosis) independently of any chemotherapy. These alterations occurred independently of anorexia and were driven by interleukin 6. Gut dysfunction was found to be resistant to treatments with an anti-inflammatory bacterium (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) or with gut peptides involved in intestinal cell renewal (teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 2 analogue). The translational value of our findings was evaluated in 152 colorectal and lung cancer patients with or without cachexia. The serum level of the lipopolysaccharidebinding protein, often presented as a reflection of the bacterial antigen load, was not only increased in cachectic mice and cancer patients, but also strongly correlated with the serum IL-6 level and predictive of death and cachexia occurrence in these patients. Altogether, our data highlight profound alterations of the intestinal homeostasis in cancer cachexia occurring independently of any chemotherapy and food intake reduction, with potential relevance in humans. In addition, we point out the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein as a new biomarker of cancer cachexia related to gut dysbiosis.},

In the past decade, the interactions between microorganisms and tumors have attracted much attention in the efforts to understand various features of the complex microbial communities, as well as the possible mechanisms through which the microbiota are involved in cancer prevention, carcinogenesis, and anti-cancer therapy. A large number of studies have indicated that microbial dysbiosis contributes to cancer susceptibility via multiple pathways. Further studies have suggested that the microbiota and their associated metabolites are not only closely related to carcinogenesis by inducing inflammation and immune dysregulation, which lead to genetic instability, but also interfere with the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents. In this article, we mainly reviewed the influence of gut microbiota on cancers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (including esophageal, gastric, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers) and the regulation of microbiota by diet, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, or the Traditional Chinese Medicine. We also proposed some new strategies in the prevention and treatment of GI cancers that could be explored in the future. We hope that this review could provide a comprehensive overview of the studies on the interactions between the gut microbiota and GI cancers, which are likely to yield translational opportunities to reduce cancer morbidity and mortality by improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.},

	abstract = {Cell lines established from the human colorectal and gastric cancers may provide very useful tools to the study of the disease and to develop and test new therapeutic approaches, and a large bank of well-characterized cell lines should reflect the diversity of tumor phenotypes and provide adequate models for the study of tumor heterogeneity. Colorectal lines are relatively easy to establish, while gastric cancer cell lines remain extremely difficult to propagate in long-term culture, and the number of cell lines is very limited. In this paper, we describe the up-to-date results of the characteristics of our nine colorectal cancer cell lines and four gastric cancer cell lines. Based on culture, xenograft, and ultrastructural morphologies, these cell lines could be subtyped into well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, poorly differentiated, and mucinous carcinomas. Basic properties concerning expression and secretion of antigens, neuroendocrine features, receptor binding of various gastrointestinal hormones and neurotransmitters, cytogenetic studies, gene amplification and expression, and chemosensitivity profiles are described. In particular, a greater number of receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters are expressed on human colorectal cancer cell lines compared to gastric cancer cell lines, raising the possibility that gastrointestinal hormones may have a greater autocrine effect on colon cancer cell growth. Despite major differences in the biology of colorectal cancer and gastric cancer as indicated by clinical studies, the multiple properties that we examined reveals marked similarities between the colorectal and gastric cancer cell lines. However, in vitro chemosensitivity patterns to cytotoxic drugs are very different in colorectal and gastric cell lines. Some of these observations may be due to the relatively low expression of the multidrug-resistance-associated (MDR1) gene in gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, colorectal cancer cell lines express receptors for peptide hormones more frequently.},

	abstract = {Sepsis is a poorly understood syndrome of systemic inflammation responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. The integrity of the gut epithelium and competence of adaptive immune responses are notoriously compromised during sepsis, and the prevalent assumption in the scientific and medical community is that intestinal commensals have a detrimental role in the systemic inflammation and susceptibility to nosocomial infections seen in critically ill, septic patients. However, breakthroughs in the last decade provide strong credence to the idea that our mucosal microbiome plays an essential role in adaptive immunity, where a human host and its prokaryotic colonists seem to exist in a carefully negotiated armistice with compromises and benefits that go both ways. In this review, we re-examine the notion that intestinal contents are the driving force of critical illness. An overview of the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system is provided, with a special focus on the impact of commensals in priming and the careful balance between normal intestinal flora and pathogenic organisms residing in the gut microbiome. Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity. As a result, normal antigen sampling becomes impaired, and proliferative cues are intermixed with inhibitory signals. This situates the microbiome, the gut, and its complex immune network of cells and bacteria, at the center of aberrant immune responses during and after sepsis.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy have once again raised the hope that a cure might be within reach for many cancer types. Yet, most late-stage cancers are either insensitive to the therapies to begin with or develop resistance later. Therapy with live tumour-targeting bacteria provides a unique option to meet these challenges. Compared with most other therapeutics, the effectiveness of tumour-targeting bacteria is not directly affected by the ‘genetic makeup’ of a tumour. Bacteria initiate their direct antitumour effects from deep within the tumour, followed by innate and adaptive antitumour immune responses. As microscopic ‘robotic factories’, bacterial vectors can be reprogrammed following simple genetic rules or sophisticated synthetic bioengineering principles to produce and deliver anticancer agents on the basis of clinical needs. Therapeutic approaches using live tumour-targeting bacteria can either be applied as a monotherapy or complement other anticancer therapies to achieve better clinical outcomes. In this Review, we summarize the potential benefits and challenges of this approach. We discuss how live bacteria selectively induce tumour regression and provide examples to illustrate different ways to engineer bacteria for improved safety and efficacy. Finally, we share our experience and insights on oncology clinical trials with tumour-targeting bacteria, including a discussion of the regulatory issues.},

We define the “hallmarks” of macrophages performing particular functions, taking into account novel insights into the diversity of their lineages, identity, and regulation.

Instead of directly promoting the apoptosis of EC cells, anti-CD47 blocking antibody promoted phagocytosis of EC cells by macrophages and the increased phagocytosis ability was mediated by M2 macrophages in a coculture assay. Besides, CD47 blockade inhibited the growth of the EC tumors

	abstract = {Purpose Recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States have been attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, but empirical evidence is lacking. Patients and Methods HPV status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Residual Tissue Repositories Program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (Inno-LiPA), HPV16 viral load, and HPV16 mRNA expression. Trends in HPV prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. Observed HPV prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. Survival of HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients was compared by using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of HPV detection assay (P trend {\textless} .05). For example, HPV prevalence by Inno-LiPA increased from 16.3\% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7\% during 2000 to 2004. Median survival was significantly longer for HPV-positive than for HPV-negative patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank P {\textless} .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.46). Survival significantly increased across calendar periods for HPV-positive (P = .003) but not for HPV-negative patients (P = .18). Population-level incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225\% (95\% CI, 208\% to 242\%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for HPV-negative cancers declined by 50\% (95\% CI, 47\% to 53\%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). If recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020. Conclusion Increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States since 1984 are caused by HPV infection.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background
Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. It is considered a major cause of health loss, but data for the global burden of sepsis are limited. As a syndrome caused by underlying infection, sepsis is not part of standard Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) estimates. Accurate estimates are important to inform and monitor health policy interventions, allocation of resources, and clinical treatment initiatives. We estimated the global, regional, and national incidence of sepsis and mortality from this disorder using data from GBD 2017.
Methods
We used multiple cause-of-death data from 109 million individual death records to calculate mortality related to sepsis among each of the 282 underlying causes of death in GBD 2017. The percentage of sepsis-related deaths by underlying GBD cause in each location worldwide was modelled using mixed-effects linear regression. Sepsis-related mortality for each age group, sex, location, GBD cause, and year (1990–2017) was estimated by applying modelled cause-specific fractions to GBD 2017 cause-of-death estimates. We used data for 8·7 million individual hospital records to calculate in-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality, stratified by underlying GBD cause. In-hospital sepsis-associated case-fatality was modelled for each location using linear regression, and sepsis incidence was estimated by applying modelled case-fatality to sepsis-related mortality estimates.
Findings
In 2017, an estimated 48·9 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 38·9–62·9) incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11·0 million (10·1–12·0) sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing 19·7\% (18·2–21·4) of all global deaths. Age-standardised sepsis incidence fell by 37·0\% (95\% UI 11·8–54·5) and mortality decreased by 52·8\% (47·7–57·5) from 1990 to 2017. Sepsis incidence and mortality varied substantially across regions, with the highest burden in sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, south Asia, east Asia, and southeast Asia.
Interpretation
Despite declining age-standardised incidence and mortality, sepsis remains a major cause of health loss worldwide and has an especially high health-related burden in sub-Saharan Africa.

	abstract = {sepsis is one of the oldest and most elusive syndromes in medicine. Hippocrates claimed that sepsis (ση´ψις) was the process by which flesh rots, swamps generate foul airs, and wounds fester.1 Galen later considered sepsis a laudable event, necessary for wound healing.2 With the confirmation of germ theory by Semmelweis, Pasteur, and others, sepsis was recast as a systemic infection, often described as “blood poisoning,” and assumed to be the result of the host’s invasion by pathogenic organisms that then spread in the bloodstream. However, with the advent of modern antibiotics, germ theory did not fully explain the pathogenesis of sepsis: many patients with sepsis died despite successful eradication of the inciting pathogen. Thus, researchers suggested that it was the host, not the germ, that drove the pathogenesis of sepsis.3 In 1992, an international consensus panel defined sepsis as a systemic inflammatory response to infection, noting that sepsis could arise in response to multiple infectious causes and that septicemia was neither a necessary condition nor a helpful term.4 Instead, the panel proposed the term “severe sepsis” to describe instances in which sepsis is complicated by acute organ dysfunction, and they codified “septic shock” as sepsis complicated by either hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation or by hyperlactatemia. In 2003, a second consensus panel endorsed most of these concepts, with the caveat that signs of a systemic inflammatory response, such as tachycardia or an elevated white-cell count, occur in many infectious and noninfectious conditions and therefore are not helpful in distinguishing sepsis from other conditions.5 Thus, “severe sepsis” and “sepsis” are sometimes used interchangeably to describe the syndrome of infection complicated by acute organ dysfunction.},

Subsequent analyses using leukocyte-specific RNA were congruent with the gene expression profiles demonstrated using whole blood-derived RNA as measured by enrichment for genes corresponding to metabolic and signaling pathways. Gene network analysis, derived from a composite gene list involving the individual gene expression profiles of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, respectively, revealed a gene network corresponding to antigen presentation, cell-mediated immunity, and humoral-mediated immunity. Finally, a subanalysis focused on network gene nodes localized to the nuclear compartment revealed functional annotations related to transcriptional repression and epigenetic regulation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS:These data demonstrate that genome-level repression of adaptive immunity gene programs early in the course of pediatric septic shock remained evident when analyses were conducted using leukocyte subset-specific RNA.},

	abstract = {My aim in this essay is to raise the question "Is there such a thing as mental illness?" and to argue that there is not. Since the notion of mental illness is extremely widely used nowadays, inquiry into the ways in which this term is employed would seem to be especially indicated. Mental illness, of course, is not literally a "thing" -- or physical object -- and hence it can "exist" only in the same sort of way in which other theoretical concepts exist. Yet, familiar theories are in the habit of posing, sooner or later -- at least to those who come to believe in them -- as "objective truths" (or "facts"). During certain historical periods, explanatory conceptions such as deities, witches, and microorganisms appeared not only as theories but as self-evident causes of a vast number of events. I submit that today mental illness is widely regarded in a somewhat similar fashion, that is, as the cause of innumerable diverse happenings. As an antidote to the complacent use of the notion of mental illness -- whether as a self-evident phenomenon, theory, or cause-- let us ask this question: What is meant when it is asserted that someone is mentally ill? In what follows I shall describe briefly the main uses to which the concept of mental illness has been put. I shall argue that this notion has outlived whatever usefulness it might have had and that it now functions merely as a convenient myth.},

SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. There-fore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Emerging data indicate that complement and neutrophils are involved in the maladaptive host immune response that fuels hyper-inflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy increasing the mortality rate in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigated the interaction between complement and the platelet/neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)/thrombin axis, using COVID-19 clinical samples, cell-based inhibition studies and NETs/human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) co-cultures. Increased plasma levels of NETs, TF activity and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. Neutrophils yielded high tissue factor (TF) expression and released NETs carrying functionally active TF. Confirming our ex vivo findings, treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAEC. Thrombin or NETosis inhibition or C5aR1 blockade attenuated platelet-mediated NET-driven thrombogenicity. Serum isolated from COVID-19 patients induces complement activation in vitro, which is consistent with high complement activity in clinical samples. Complement inhibition at the level of C3 with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils. In conclusion, we provide a mechanistic basis that reveals the pivotal role of complement and NETs in COVID-19 immmunothrombosis. This study supports emerging strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection that exploit complement therapeutics or NETosis inhibition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We performed an integrated immune analysis on a cohort of 50 COVID-19 patients with various disease severity. A unique phenotype was observed in severe and critical patients, consisting of a highly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response (characterized by no IFN-β and low IFN-α production and activity), associated with a persistent blood viral load and an exacerbated inflammatory response. Inflammation was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NF-κB and characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling. These data suggest that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood could be a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and provide a rationale for combined therapeutic approaches.},

We identified extensive induction and activation of multiple immune lineages, including T cell activation, oligoclonal plasmablast expansion, and Fc and trafficking receptor modulation on innate lymphocytes and granulocytes, that distinguished severe COVID-19 cases from healthy donors or SARS-CoV-2-recovered or moderate severity patients. We found the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio to be a prognostic biomarker of disease severity and organ failure. Our findings demonstrate broad innate and adaptive leukocyte perturbations that distinguish dysregulated host responses in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrant therapeutic investigation.

While most patients experience only mild symptoms, a relevant proportion develop severe disease progression with increasing hypoxia up to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The substantial number of patients with severe disease have strained intensive care capacities to an unprecedented level. Owing to the highly variable course and lack of reliable predictors for deterioration, we aimed to identify variables that allow the prediction of patients with a high risk of respiratory failure and need of mechanical ventilation Patients with PCR proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection hospitalized at our institution from 29th February to 27th March 2020 (n=40) were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation 13/40 (32.5\%) did not differ in age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation (p=1.2.10$^{\textrm{-5}}$). In addition, the maximal IL-6 level (cutoff 80 pg/ml) for each patient during disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (p=1.7.10$^{\textrm{-8}}$, AUC=0.98). The risk of respiratory failure for patients with IL-6 levels of ≥ 80 pg/ml was 22 times higher compared to patients with lower IL-6 levels. In the current situation with overwhelmed intensive care units and overcrowded emergency rooms, correct triage of patients in need of intensive care is crucial. Our study shows that IL-6 is an effective marker that might be able to predict upcoming respiratory failure with high accuracy and help physicians correctly allocate patients at an early stage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients’ lymphopenia.

Patient throat swabs were tested daily for SARS-CoV-2, with the virus persisting for 3 to 4 weeks in all three patients. Cytokine analyses of whole blood revealed increased cytokine expression in the single most severe case. However, most inflammatory gene expression peaked after respiratory function nadir, except expression in the IL1 pathway. Parallel analyses of CD4 and CD8 expression suggested that the pro-inflammatory response may be intertwined with T cell activation that could exacerbate disease or prolong the infection.

Severe disease has been associated with changes in peripheral immune activity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines3,4 that may be produced by a subset of inflammatory monocytes5,6, lymphopenia7,8 and T cell exhaustion9,10. To elucidate pathways in peripheral immune cells that might lead to immunopathology or protective immunity in severe COVID-19, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven patients hospitalized for COVID-19, four of whom had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and six healthy controls. We identify reconfiguration of peripheral immune cell phenotype in COVID-19, including a heterogeneous interferon-stimulated gene signature, HLA class II downregulation and a developing neutrophil population that appears closely related to plasmablasts appearing in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Importantly, we found that peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes do not express substantial amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

	abstract = {Cytokine drivers of COVID-19
By carrying out single-cell RNA sequencing analyses on immune cells in the blood, Lee et al. have compared immune responses in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 with immune responses in severe cases of influenza. They report TNF/IL-1β–driven inflammation as defining characteristics of COVID-19 that was relatively weak in the response to influenza. By further comparing the transcriptomes of mild and severe cases of COVID-19, they found type I interferons to be key drivers of inflammation in severe COVID-19. By profiling the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and flu in parallel, Lee et al. have shed new light on the similarities and differences between the immune responses to these two distinct respiratory viruses.
Although most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–infected individuals experience mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), some patients suffer from severe COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation. To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyperinflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of the tumor necrosis factor/interleukin-1β (TNF/IL-1β)–driven inflammatory response as compared with severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I interferon (IFN) response coexisted with the TNF/IL-1β–driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19. We documented type I IFN–driven inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. On the basis of this, we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe COVID-19.

	abstract = {Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutic and public health strategies. Viral–host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality—effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multimodal analytical approach to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility and clinical outcome associated with infection.},

	abstract = {Objective To delineate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.
Design Retrospective case series.
Setting Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
Participants Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020.
Main outcome measures Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.
Results The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73\%) than in recovered patients (88; 55\%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48\%) and 16 (14\%)) than recovered patients (39 (24\%) and 7 (4\%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62\%), 55 (49\%), and 25 (22\%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31\%), 48 (30\%), and 1 (1\%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50\%) patients who died and 6 (4\%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91\%) and 76 (47\%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100\%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51\%), sepsis (113; 100\%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77\%), heart failure (41/83; 49\%), alkalosis (14/35; 40\%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37\%), acute kidney injury (28; 25\%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20\%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.
Conclusion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The pathogenesis of COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), involves a complex host-virus interaction and is characterised by an exaggerated immune response, the specific components of which are poorly understood. Here we report the outcome of a longitudinal immune profiling study in hospitalised patients during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK and show the relationship between immune responses and severity of the clinical presentation. Methods The Coronavirus Immune Response and Clinical Outcomes (CIRCO) study was conducted at four hospitals in Greater Manchester. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited as close to admission as possible, provided peripheral blood samples at enrolment and sequentially thereafter. Fresh samples were assessed for immune cells and proteins in whole blood and serum. Some samples were also stimulated for 3 hours with LPS and analysed for intracellular proteins. Results were stratified based on patient-level data including severity of symptoms and date of reported symptom onset. Findings Longitudinal analysis showed a very high neutrophil to T cell ratio and abnormal activation of monocytes in the blood, which displayed high levels of the cell cycle marker, Ki67 and low COX-2. These properties all reverted in patient with good outcome. Unexpectedly, multiple aspects of inflammation were diminished as patients progressed in severity and time, even in ITU patients not recovering. Interpretation This is the first detailed longitudinal analysis of COVID-19 patients of varying severity and outcome, revealing common features and aspects that track with severity. Patients destined for a severe outcome can be identified at admission when still displaying mild-moderate symptoms. We provide clues concerning pathogenesis that should influence clinical trials and therapeutics. Targeting pathways involved in neutrophil and monocyte release from the bone marrow should be tested in patients with COVID-19.

	abstract = {Objective
Approximately 5\% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop a life-threatening pneumonia that often occurs in the setting of increased inflammation or “cytokine storm”. Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point.
Methods
Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC).
Results
In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40\% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62\% of cases were ventilated and there were three deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and one serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p {\textless} 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients.
Conclusion
Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.},

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24-72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65\%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0-2]), 7 (12\%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23\%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74\%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2\%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24\%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77\%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23\%) patients, of whom 20 (20\%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a HIS. During the 10-day follow-up, three cases of severe adverse events were recorded: two patients developed septic shock and died, one had gastrointestinal perforation requiring urgent surgery and was alive at day 10. In conclusion, our series showed that COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS was characterized by HIS. The response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist with the ability to suppress the cytokine storm in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between 3/13/20 and 4/16/20. This was a multi-center study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within one (1) day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered greater than one (1) day after intubation. In the absence of mechanical ventilation, the timing of the dose was related to the patient9s date of admission only. Results: We evaluated 145 patients. The average age was 58.1 years, 64\% were male, 68.3\% had comorbidities, and 60\% received steroid therapy. Disposition of patients was 48.3\% discharged and 29.3\% expired, of which 43.9\% were African American. Mechanical ventilation was required in 55.9\%, of which 34.5\% expired. Avoidance of MV (p value = 0.002) and increased survival (p value \&lt; 0.001) was statistically associated with early dosing. Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy was effective at decreasing mortality and should be instituted early in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease-19 pandemic (COVID-19), which appeared in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread throughout the world, has forced clinicians and scientists to take up extraordinary challenges. This unprecedented situation led to the inception of numerous fundamental research protocols and many clinical trials. It quickly became apparent that although COVID-19, in the vast majority of cases, was a benign disease, it could also develop a severe form with sometimes fatal outcomes. Cytokines are central to the pathophysiology of COVID-19; while some of them are beneficial (type-I interferon, interleukin-7), others appear detrimental (interleukin-1β, -6, and TNF-α) particularly in the context of the so-called cytokine storm. Yet another characteristic of the disease has emerged: concomitant immunodeficiency, notably involving impaired type-I interferon response, and lymphopenia. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19 immunopathology. We discuss the defective type-I IFN response, the theoretical role of IL-7 to restore lymphocyte repertoire, as well as we mention the two patterns observed in severe COVID-19 (i.e. interleukin-1β-driven macrophage activation syndrome vs. interleukin-6-driven immune dysregulation). Next, reviewing current evidence drawn from clinical trials, we examine a number of cytokine and anti-cytokine therapies, including interleukin-1, -6, and TNF inhibitors, as well as less targeted therapies, such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, or JAK inhibitors.,

	abstract = {The immune spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is poorly understood. To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41–60 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly in acute-phase. CD3+CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes were decreased by 36.78\% in the convalescent patients. Conclusion: SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time. Prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-β may play an important role in the disease.},

The sudden clinical deterioration 7–8 days after initial symptom onset suggests that severe respiratory failure (SRF) in COVID-19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction. We studied immune responses of 54 COVID-19 patients, 28 of whom had SRF. All patients with SRF displayed either macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or very low human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression accompanied by profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by circulating monocytes was sustained, a pattern distinct from bacterial sepsis or influenza. SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab; off-label Tocilizumab treatment of patients was accompanied by increase in circulating lymphocytes. Thus, the unique pattern of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 is characterized by IL-6-mediated low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia, associated with sustained cytokine production and hyper-inflammation.},

	abstract = {In the pathogenesis of sepsis, inflammation and coagulation play a pivotal role. Increasing evidence points to an extensive cross-talk between these two systems, whereby inflammation leads to activation of coagulation, and coagulation also considerably affects inflammatory activity. Molecular pathways that contribute to inflammation-induced activation of coagulation have been precisely identified. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators are capable of activating the coagulation system and down-regulating important physiologic anticoagulant pathways. Activation of the coagulation system and ensuing thrombin generation is dependent on expression of tissue factor and the simultaneous down-regulation of endothelial-bound anticoagulant mechanisms and endogenous fibrinolysis. Conversely, activated coagulation proteases may affect specific cellular receptors on inflammatory cells and endothelial cells and thereby modulate the inflammatory response.},

	abstract = {Objective—Activation of neutrophils by microbial or inflammatory stimuli results in the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are composed of DNA, histones, and antimicrobial proteins. In purified systems, cell-free DNA (CFDNA) activates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, whereas histones promote thrombin generation through platelet-dependent mechanisms. However, the overall procoagulant effects of CFDNA/histone complexes as part of intact NETs are unknown. In this study, we examined the procoagulant potential of intact NETs released from activated neutrophils. We also determined the relative contribution of CFDNA and histones to thrombin generation in plasmas from patients with sepsis.Approach and Results—NETs released from phorbyl myristate–activated neutrophils enhance thrombin generation in platelet-poor plasma. This effect was DNA dependent (confirmed by DNase treatment) and occurred via the intrinsic pathway of coagulation (confirmed with coagulation factor XII– and coagulation factor XI–depleted plasma). In platelet-rich plasma treated with corn trypsin inhibitor, addition of phorbyl myristate–activated neutrophils increased thrombin generation and shortened the lag time in a toll-like receptor-2– and toll-like receptor-4–dependent mechanism. Addition of DNase further augmented thrombin generation, suggesting that dismantling of the NET scaffold increases histone-mediated, platelet-dependent thrombin generation. In platelet-poor plasma samples from patients with sepsis, we found a positive correlation between endogenous CFDNA and thrombin generation, and addition of DNase attenuated thrombin generation.Conclusions—These studies examine the procoagulant activities of CFDNA and histones in the context of NETs. Our studies also implicate a role for the intrinsic pathway of coagulation in sepsis pathogenesis.},

The expression of proinflammatory genes, especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly triggered expression of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils.

During NETosis, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which can capture and kill bacteria and other pathogens to prevent them from spreading. Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of NETosis, the precise mechanism underlying NETosis is still a matter of debate. Research continues to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in NETosis. In recent years, interactions with the complement and coagulation systems have become increasingly apparent. Activated complement proteins can stimulate NET formation, and NETs, in turn, can serve as a platform for complement activation. In addition, NETs can act as a scaffold for thrombus formation during coagulation. While crosstalk between the coagulation and complement systems has been previously described, NETosis appears to be a third important player in this consortium to protect the host against pathogens. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the mutual interactions between NETosis, the complement system and the coagulation system, with an emerging description of their complex triangular relationship.},

In this review, we discuss what is known about the role of the innate immune system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggest directions for future studies, and evaluate proposed COVID-19 immunomodulating therapeutics., In this Minireview, Julia McKechnie and Catherine Blish discuss recent studies on the role of the innate immune response during SARS-Cov2 infection. They provide insights into the potential of immunomodulatory drugs as therapies and identify gaps for furthering our understanding of COVID-19.},

Diagnostics can be used to identify outlying or influential samples, and also to evaluate model fit and explore model expansion., Results: We demonstrate this methodology on an adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) dataset, using GSEA based on chromosome-band mapping of genes. Individual residuals, grouped or aggregated by chromosomal loci, indicate problematic samples and potential data-entry errors, and help identify hyperdiploidy as a factor playing a key role in expression for this dataset. Subsequent analysis pinpoints suspected DNA copy number abnormalities of specific samples and chromosomes (most prevalent are chromosomes X, 21 and 14), and also reveals significant expression differences between the hyperdiploid and diploid groups on other chromosomes (most prominently 19, 22, 3 and 13)—differences which are apparently not associated with copy number., Availability: Software for the statistical tools demonstrated in this article is available as Bioconductor package GSEAlm., Contact: assaf.oron@gmail.com, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have provided insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. However, the longitudinal immunological correlates of disease outcome remain unclear. Here we serially analysed immune responses in 113 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. Immune profiling revealed an overall increase in innate cell lineages, with a concomitant reduction in T cell number. An early elevation in cytokine levels was associated with worse disease outcomes. Following an early increase in cytokines, patients with moderate COVID-19 displayed a progressive reduction in type 1 (antiviral) and type 3 (antifungal) responses. By contrast, patients with severe COVID-19 maintained these elevated responses throughout the course of the disease. Moreover, severe COVID-19 was accompanied by an increase in multiple type 2 (anti-helminths) effectors, including interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-13, immunoglobulin E and eosinophils. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four immune signatures, representing growth factors (A), type-2/3 cytokines (B), mixed type-1/2/3 cytokines (C), and chemokines (D) that correlated with three distinct disease trajectories. The immune profiles of patients who recovered from moderate COVID-19 were enriched in tissue reparative growth factor signature A, whereas the profiles of those with who developed severe disease had elevated levels of all four signatures. Thus, we have identified a maladapted immune response profile associated with severe COVID-19 and poor clinical outcome, as well as early immune signatures that correlate with divergent disease trajectories.},

Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we offer an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other respiratory viruses. Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response. This response is defined by low levels of type I and III interferons juxtaposed to elevated chemokines and high expression of IL-6. We propose that reduced innate antiviral defenses coupled with exuberant inflammatory cytokine production are the defining and driving features of COVID-19.},

Hydroxyurea (HU) is licensed by the FDA for reducing frequency of VOCs in SCD; increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) together with reduction of the neutrophil count and circulating inflammatory markers, contribute to its clinical efficacy. Here, using paired plasma samples from HbSS patients (in steady-state and VOC) we determined that despite HU treatment, the SCD environment remained highly inflammatory and particularly at VOC, triggered neutrophil activity. While neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) induction by the steady state plasmas were comparable to that of plasma from healthy donors, the NETs response triggered by crisis plasmas was significantly increased over that of the steady state (P = 0.0124*). Levels of IL-6 and IL-1α, IL-1ra/IL1F3 and adhesion molecule P-selectin were significantly increased in the VOC plasma when compared with steady state plasma. Higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1ra were also found in the crises samples that yielded an increased NETs response suggesting that increased NETs production associated with increased levels of the inflammatory products of the IL-6 family and regulators of IL-1 family of cytokines during sickle VOCs.},

	abstract = {Complement activation is involved in a variety of retinal diseases. We have shown previously that a number of complement components and regulators can be produced locally in the eye, and that retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are the major source of complement expression at the retina–choroidal interface. The expression of complement components by RPE cells is regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Under aging or inflammatory conditions, microglia and macrophages accumulate in the subretinal space, where they are in close contact with RPE cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of activated macrophages on complement expression by RPE cells. Mouse RPE cells were treated with the supernatants from un-activated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-DMs), the classically activated BM-DMs (M1) and different types of the alternatively activated BM-DMs (M2a by IL-4, M2b by immune complex and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), M2c by IL-10). The expression of inflammatory cytokines and complement genes by RPE cells were determined by real-time RT-PCR. The protein expression of CFB, C3, C1INH, and C1r was examined by Western blot. Our results show that un-stimulated RPE cells express a variety of complement-related genes, and that the expression levels of complement regulators, including C1r, factor H (CFH), DAF1, CD59, C1INH, Crry, and C4BP genes are significantly higher than those of complement component genes (C2, C4, CFB, C3, and C5). Macrophage supernatants increased inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS), chemokine (CCL2) and complement expression in RPE cells. The supernatants from M0, M2a and M2c macrophages mildly up-regulated (2–3.5-fold) CFB, CFH and C3 gene expression in RPE cells, whereas the supernatants from M1 and M2b macrophages massively increased (10–30-fold) CFB and C3 gene expression in RPE cells. The expression of other genes, including C1r, C2, C4, CFH, Masp1, C1INH, and C4BP in RPE cells was also increased by the supernatants of M1 and M2b macrophages; however, the increment levels were significantly lower than CFB and C3 genes. M1 and M2b macrophage supernatants enhanced CFB (Bb fragment) protein expression and C3 secretion by RPE cells. M1 macrophages may affect complement expression in RPE cells through the STAT1 pathway. Our results suggest that under inflammatory conditions, activated macrophages could promote the alternative pathway of complement activation in the retina via induction of RPE cell CFB and C3 expression.},

We studied complement activation on NETs and a Gram-negative opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA01, PAKwt, PAKgfp).

In response to PMA or P. aeruginosa, neutrophils secrete CFP, deposit it on NETs and bacteria, and induce the formation of terminal complement complexes (C5b-9). A blocking anti-CFP antibody inhibited AP-mediated but not non-AP-mediated complement activation on NETs and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, NET-mediated complement activation occurs via both AP- and non AP-based mechanisms, and AP-mediated complement activation during NETosis is dependent on CFP. These findings suggest that neutrophils could use their “AP tool kit” to readily activate complement on NETs and Gram-negative bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, whereas additional components present in the serum help to fix non-AP-mediated complement both on NETs and bacteria. This unique mechanism may play important roles in host defense, and help to explain specific roles of complement activation in NET-related diseases.},

We have termed the lung-restricted vascular immunopathology associated with COVID-19 as diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, which in its early stages is distinct from disseminated intravascular coagulation. Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations (reflecting pulmonary vascular bed thrombosis with fibrinolysis) and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations (reflecting emergent ventricular stress induced by pulmonary hypertension) in the face of normal fibrinogen and platelet levels are key early features of severe pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy related to COVID-19. Extensive immunothrombosis over a wide pulmonary vascular territory without confirmation of COVID-19 viraemia in early disease best explains the adverse impact of male sex, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19 involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive immunothrombosis, which might unmask subclinical cardiovascular disease and is distinct from the MAS and disseminated intravascular coagulation that is more familiar to rheumatologists.},

	abstract = {Despite clear differences in immune system responses and in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases between males and females, there is little understanding of the processes involved. In this study, we identified a gene signature of immature-like neutrophils, characterized by the overexpression of genes encoding for several granule-containing proteins, which was found at higher levels (up to 3-fold) in young (20-30 y old) but not older (60 to {\textgreater}89 y old) males compared with females. Functional and phenotypic characterization of peripheral blood neutrophils revealed more mature and responsive neutrophils in young females, which also exhibited an elevated capacity in neutrophil extracellular trap formation at baseline and upon microbial or sterile autoimmune stimuli. The expression levels of the immature-like neutrophil signature increased linearly with pregnancy, an immune state of increased susceptibility to certain infections. Using mass cytometry, we also find increased frequencies of immature forms of neutrophils in the blood of women during late pregnancy. Thus, our findings show novel sex differences in innate immunity and identify a common neutrophil signature in males and in pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Severe sepsis is almost invariably associated with systemic activation of coagulation. There is ample evidence that demonstrates a wide-ranging cross-talk between hemostasis and inflammation, which is probably implicated in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis. Inflammation not only leads to initiation and propagation of coagulation activity, but coagulation also markedly influences inflammation. Molecular mechanisms that play a role in inflammation-induced effects on coagulation have been recognized in much detail. Pro-inflammatory cells and cyto- and chemokines can activate the coagulation system and downregulate crucial physiological anticoagulant mechanisms. Initiation of coagulation activation and consequent thrombin generation is caused by expression of tissue factor on activated monocytes and endothelial cells and is ineffectually offset by tissue factor pathway inhibitor. At the same time, endothelial-associated anticoagulant pathways, in particular the protein C system, is impaired by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Also, fibrin removal is severely obstructed by inactivation of the endogenous fibrinolytic system, mainly as a result of upregulation of its principal inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Increased fibrin generation and impaired break down lead to deposition of (micro)vascular clots, which may contribute to tissue ischemia and ensuing organ dysfunction. The foundation of the management of coagulation in sepsis is the explicit and thorough treatment of the underlying disorder by antibiotic treatment and source control measures. Adjunctive strategies focused at the impairment of coagulation, including anticoagulants and restoration of physiological anticoagulant mechanisms, may supposedly be indicated and have been found advantageous in experimental and initial clinical trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sepsis, defined by the presence of infection and host inflammation, is a lethal clinical syndrome with an increasing mortality rate worldwide. In severe disease, the coagulation system becomes diffusely activated, with consumption of multiple clotting factors resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). When present, DIC portends a higher mortality rate. Understanding the mechanisms that tie inflammation and diffuse thrombosis will allow therapeutic interventions to be developed. The coagulopathy of acute sepsis is a dynamic process that is time and disease burden specific. Whole-blood testing of coagulation may provide more clinically useful information than the classical tests. Natural anticoagulants that regulate thrombosis are downregulated in sepsis. Patients may benefit from the modulation of the coagulation system when systemic inflammation and hypercoagulopathy exist. Proper timing of anticoagulant therapy may ultimately lead to decreased incidence of multisystem organ dysfunction.
RECENT FINDINGS: The pathogenesis of coagulopathy in sepsis is driven by an upregulation of procoagulant mechanisms and simultaneous downregulation of natural anticoagulants. Inflammation caused by the invading organism is a natural host defense that cannot be eliminated during treatment. Successful strategies to prevent multisystem organ dysfunction center on stratifying patients at high risk for DIC and restoring the balance of inflammation and coagulation.
SUMMARY: The prevention of DIC in septic patients is a key therapeutic target in preventing death from multisystem organ failure. Stratifying patients for therapy using thromboelastometry, specific markers for DIC, and composite scoring systems is an area of growing research.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}SUMMARY{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Viruses deploy an array of genetically encoded strategies to coopt host machinery and support viral replicative cycles. Molecular mimicry, manifested by structural similarity between viral and endogenous host proteins, allow viruses to harness or disrupt cellular functions including nucleic acid metabolism and modulation of immune responses. Here, we use protein structure similarity to scan for virally encoded structure mimics across thousands of catalogued viruses and hosts spanning broad ecological niches and taxonomic range, including bacteria, plants and fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates. Our survey identified over 6,000,000 instances of structural mimicry, the vast majority of which (\&gt;70\%) cannot be discerned through protein sequence. The results point to molecular mimicry as a pervasive strategy employed by viruses and indicate that the protein structure space used by a given virus is dictated by the host proteome. Interrogation of proteins mimicked by human-infecting viruses points to broad diversification of cellular pathways targeted via structural mimicry, identifies biological processes that may underly autoimmune disorders, and reveals virally encoded mimics that may be leveraged to engineer synthetic metabolic circuits or may serve as targets for therapeutics. Moreover, the manner and degree to which viruses exploit molecular mimicry varies by genome size and nucleic acid type, with ssRNA viruses circumventing limitations of their small genomes by mimicking human proteins to a greater extent than their large dsDNA counterparts. Finally, we identified over 140 cellular proteins that are mimicked by CoV, providing clues about cellular processes driving the pathogenesis of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A recent study by Wilk et al. of the transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in seven patients hospitalized with COVID-19 described a population of 9developing neutrophils9 that were 9phenotypically related by dimensionality reduction9 to plasmablasts, and that these two cell populations represent a 9linear continuum of cellular phenotype9. The authors suggest that, in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe COVID-19, a 9differentiation bridge from plasmablasts to developing neutrophils9 connected these distantly related cell types. This conclusion is controversial as it appears to violate several basic principles in cell biology relating to cell lineage identity and fidelity. Correctly classifying cells and their developmental history is an important issue in cell biology and we suggest that this conclusion is not supported by the data as we show here that: (1) regressing out covariates such as unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can lead to overfitting; and (2) that UMAP embeddings may reflect the expression of similar genes but not necessarily direct cell lineage relationships.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic resulting in an escalating number of cases and fatalities worldwide. Preliminary evidence from these patients, as well as past coronavirus epidemics, indicates that those infected suffer from disproportionate complement activation as well as excessive coagulation, leading to thrombotic complications and poor outcome. In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells. We also describe how these interactions see clinical relevance in several disorders where overactive complement results in a prothrombotic clinical presentation, and how it could be clinically relevant in COVID-19.,
